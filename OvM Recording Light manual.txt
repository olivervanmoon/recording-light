OvM Recording Light

The recording light can work with any DAW that supports Mackie Control protocol, including Logic Pro X and Ableton Live, or the M-Audio Keyboard control protocol as used by Pro Tools. (Note: Mackie Control is not the same as the older Mackie "HUI" protocol, which is also available for Pro Tools, but is not used with this setup.) The recording light has been tested with  Logic Pro X, Ableton Live, and Pro Tools.
